The [Flemish Archive for Annotated Music](https://www.ap-arts.be/en/research/faam-flemish-archive-annotated-music) (FAAM) is an interdisciplinary digital project that explores the rich performance practices of musicians from 1800 to 1950 by analyzing the annotations they left on musical scores. These annotations offer valuable insights into the artistic decisions of the past, particularly in the absence of original recordings. FAAM's extensive digital corpus features around 30,000 annotated images and 600 scores, complete with detailed metadata and a specialized training set for image segmentation. This archive serves as a crucial resource for research and innovation across fields such as Computer Vision, Optical Music Recognition, Computational Musicology, and Artistic Research.
