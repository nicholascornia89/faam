Examples of collective annotations built on automatic annotations are also given. This platform will be officially open to public on Internet and inside the new building of the Archives departementales des Yvelines in December 2003. 1200000 images of civil status registers will be available for collective annotation as well as 35000 pages of military forms with automatic annotation of handwritten names.},

Our study analyzes the papers published in the last few years on this topic from different perspectives: we first provide a pragmatic definition of historical documents from the point of view of the research in the area, then we look at the various sub-tasks addressed in this research. Guided by these tasks, we go through the different input-output relations that are expected from the used deep learning approaches and therefore we accordingly describe the most used models. We also discuss research datasets published in the field and their applications. This analysis shows that the latest research is a leap forward since it is not the simple use of recently proposed algorithms to previous problems, but novel tasks and novel applications of state of the art methods are now considered. Rather than just providing a conclusive picture of the current research in the topic we lastly suggest some potential future trends that can represent a stimulus for innovative research directions.},

However, scores are a central part of many musicians’ creative work, and a complete conception of creativity in performance should take this centrality into account. This article investigates performers’ uses of notation, particularly annotation, in both composed and improvised musical practices. Using observational methods, we examine how performers engage with their notations and how this engagement resonates in their creative processes. By approaching the score as a concrete material object rather than a representation of an abstract structure, we move beyond a paradigm that opposes notated permanence to performed and/or improvised transience. Drawing on anthropological work on artistic production, creativity, and improvisation, we propose an understanding of (an)notation as integral to the forms of imagination, creativity, knowledge, interaction, and even improvisation that occur in music-making.},

  abstract  = {In a meeting at King's College London in May 2000, John Unsworth proposed a list of seven ‘scholarly primitives’ which he claimed were ‘self-understood’ functions forming the basis for ‘higher-level scholarly projects, arguments, statements [and] interpretations’ (Unsworth, 2000). He claimed that his list summarized activities that were ‘basic to scholarship across eras and across media’, and went on to say that an analysis of these scholarly primitives might result in a clearer sense of how computing tools could support the scholarly endeavour. Here we focus on the primitive that was second on Unsworth's list, after ‘Discovering’: ‘Annotation’.

Our work on annotation arises out of a developing awareness that established Humanities Computing (HC) areas of interest, do not seem always to connect with the actual process of the research work being carried out by most humanists. We claimed in Bradley (2005) that a fundamentally different usage paradigm than those in operation in established HC was necessary to even notice, and then follow-up on, the potential of scholarly annotation as a computer-supported activity.

This article presents our experiences, and the eventual outcomes, of the process of developing annotations tools for the Online Chopin Variorum Edition project (OCVE).1 Beginning with a brief overview of activities related to annotation in Humanities Computing and Computing Science, we introduce the visible parts of the OCVE project, and address some discussion to the structures behind the scenes that support what it does, reporting what worked and what did not. We conclude by analysing the significance of our findings and describing the direction we think our annotation tool will take.},

In addition, our scenario considers a human-aided computing approach in which the user is part of the recognition loop, providing feedback where relevant errors are made.},

Despite their inarguable complexity, these contents are often ignored by digital libraries, where music scores are mostly treated as simple digital images. This paper reports on the development and application of MusicOWL, an ontology to formally describe music scores contents for western music. Unlike other efforts on the subject, MusicOWL provides a comprehensive vocabulary for annotating music scores, which covers important music-related information, such as melodies, dynamics, and tonalities. We also report on the Linked Music Score dataset creation, including all necessary steps from scanned music scores to RDF triples, and how this linked music score data enables users to search for music scores by using handy queries, thus translating the needs of many music professionals, data curators and online learners. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the search engine WWU Music Score Portal, which uses the approach proposed in this work to improve music scores discovery and support online learning of music.},

  abstract     = {Transforming C19 HIP (TCHIP) is a 5-year research project hosted by the University of Oxford Faculty of Music. The project began in April 2016 and is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
 
The orchestral and chamber music of the C19th is some of the most widely performed music, and yet – until now – most professional performances of this repertoire have been relatively untouched by what is known about C19th historical style. TCHIP seeks to understand why historical performance scholarship has had little influence on professional performance, and aims to bridge the widely-recognized gap between performers and scholars.
 
What makes this project different is that it deliberately employs innovative, interdisciplinary approaches and methods. Half of the research team have backgrounds in historical performance and musicology, and the other half in empirical musicology. The research strands are conceived, planned and delivered in ways that reflect these different fields and move away from the methods commonly used in traditional HIP (historically informed performance) scholarship.
 
The project’s historical research is deliberately not focussed on the study of virtuosi and treatises; rather, we employ research methods associated with social and cultural musicology, and aim to contribute to knowledge of under-researched groups (e.g. orchestral and theatre musicians). Similarly, our focus is not on the public act of performance, but on everything that leads up that point. Previous research has been overwhelmingly centred on performance, despite the fact that performance is only the final stage of a process that leads from initial preparation through rehearsal to public presentation. We believe that changing performance depends upon changing ‘pre-performance’ – the rich and complex set of practices that precede performance. We spend a lot of time in archives in the UK, USA and Europe looking at a wide variety of sources (newspapers, journals, letters etc) and we have studied several large collections of annotated orchestral parts spanning the entire C19th.
 
We will be looking at the development of HIP over the last 30 years and examining current practices in HIP ensembles, as well as the impact of specialist conservatoire training on professional period instrument performance. We are also researching the experiences of HIP audiences, and will be engaging with industry management professionals to look at how the realities of the profession today influence artistic planning, rehearsal/performance and attitudes to historical performance research.},

These systems generally have two phases: recognizing the graphical symbols (such as note-heads and lines) and determining the musical meaning and relationships of the symbols (such as the pitch and rhythm of the notes). In this paper we explore the second phase and give a two-step approach that admits an economical representation of the parsing rules for the system. The approach is flexible and allows the system to be extended to new notations with little effort—the current system can parse common music notation, Sacred Harp notation and plainsong. It is based on a string grammar and a customizable graph that specifies relationships between musical objects. We observe that this graph can be related to printing as well as recognizing music notation, bringing the opportunity for cross-fertilization between the two areas of research.

Leveraging from Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques and Linked Open Data (LOD), in this paper we demonstrate a new form of music digital library that encompasses management, discovery, delivery, and analysis of the musical content it contains. Utilizing open source tools such as Greenstone, audioDB, Meandre, and Apache Jena we present a series of transformations to a musical digital library sourced from audio files that steadily increases the level of support provided to the user for musicological study. While the seed for this work was motivated by better supporting musicologists in a digital library, the developed software architecture alters the boundaries to what is conventionally thought of as a digital library- and in doing so challenges core assumptions made in mainstream digital library software design.},

  abstract  = {Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing and then later retrieving their image collections. However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval.},

  abstract     = {The Web and other digital technologies have democratised music
creation, reception, and analysis, putting music in the hands, ears,
and minds of billions of users. Music digital libraries typically focus
on an essential subset of this deluge—commercial and academic
publications, and historical materials—but neglect to incorporate
contributions by scholars, performers, and enthusiasts, such as
annotations or performed interpretations of these artifacts, despite
their potential utility for many types of users.
In this paper we consider means by which digital libraries for musicology may incorporate such contributions into their collections,
adhering to principles of FAIR data management and respecting
contributor rights as outlined in the EU’s General Data Protection
Regulation. We present an overview of centralised and decentralised
approaches to this problem, and propose hybrid solutions in which
contributions reside in a) user-controlled personal online datastores,
b) decentralised file storage, and c) are published and aggregated
into digital library collections. We outline the implementation of
these ideas using Solid, a Web decentralisation project building on
W3C standard technologies to facilitate publication and control
over Linked Data. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
by implementing prototypes supporting two types of contribution:
Web Annotations describing or analysing musical elements in score
encodings and music recordings; and, music performances and associated metadata supporting performance analyses across many
renditions of a given piece. Finally, we situate these ideas within
a wider conception of enriched, decentralised, and interconnected
online music repositories.},

As the Web becomes ever more enmeshed with our daily lives, there is a growing desire for direct access to raw data not currently available on the Web or bound up in hypertext documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards - the Web of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we provide readers with a detailed technical introduction to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data, including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text is based around two main themes - the publication and consumption of Linked Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of existing Linked Data applications and then examine the architectures that are used to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application development, research or further study.},

  abstract  = {Cultural heritage consists of heterogeneous resources: archaeological artefacts, monuments, sites, landscapes, paintings, photos, books and expressions of human creativity, often enjoyed in different forms: tangible, intangible or digital. Each resource is usually documented, conserved and managed by cultural institutes like museums, libraries or holders of archives. These institutes make available a detailed description of the objects as catalog records. In this context, the chapter proposes both a classification of cultural heritage data types and a process for cultural heritage valorisation through the well-known Linked Open Data paradigm. The classification and process have been defined in the context of a collaboration between the Semantic Technology Laboratory of the National Research Council (STLab) and the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MIBACT) that the chapter describes, although we claim they are sufficiently general to be adopted in every cultural heritage scenario. In particular, the chapter introduces both a suite of ontology modules named Cultural-ON to model the principal elements identified in the cultural heritage data type classification, and the process we employed for data valorisation purposes. To this end, semantic technologies are exploited; that is, technologies that allow us to conceptualise and describe the meaning of data forming the cultural heritage and including such entities as places, institutions, cultural heritage events, availability, etc. These entities have special characteristics and are connected with each other in a profound way. The result is a knowledge base consisting of semantic interconnections with also other data available in the Web to be exploited according to different tasks and users preferences. By navigating the semantic relationships between the various objects of the knowledge base, new semantic paths can be revealed and utilised with the aim to develop innovative services and applications. The process is compliant with Linked Open Data and W3C Semantic Web best practices so that to enable a wider promotion of cultural heritage, and of sharing and reuse of cultural heritage data in the Web. The chapter concludes presenting a number of methodological principles and lessons learnt from the STLab/MIBACT collaboration that are applicable to any cultural heritage context and, in some cases, also to other domains.},

  abstract = {{In Western art music, the idea of the professional performer as a versatile interpreter of someone else’s music consolidated around the turn of the nineteenth century. The institutionalization of instrumental training in dedicated schools (such as the Paris Conservatoire, established in 1795) favoured an increasing specialization of composers and performers in their respective tasks. Scholars have often traced the development of these modern professional identities to fundamental innovations in the fabric and conceptions of musical notation. The newly detailed scores by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven specify articulation, phrasing, and even fingerings, suggesting a growing authority of the composer over the performer’s moves, and the score itself as an increasingly important focus of the musical event (scripting both what performers should do and what listeners, ideally, should discern). Rather than focusing on how music was notated by composers, this article proposes to explore the perspective of the performers handling it: how they understood their role in bringing the score to life, and the realms of commentary they inspired in Parisian debates about the progress of the art and the mechanization of performance in the early nineteenth century. At the core of the Paris Conservatoire’s universal pedagogical project, the violinist Pierre Baillot (1771–1842) devised a prototype professional figure for the future of instrumental performance across genres: not a puppet-musician controlled via invisible strings, but an architect of musical impersonations, able to stimulate images or stories in the listeners’ minds and leave them theatrically spellbound.}},

Emerging in London in 1829, this was an enormously popular brand of commercial publication conventionally produced for holiday sales. One particular copy – given as a present to an 11-year-old girl that year – proves a useful starting point from which to interrogate these items as a whole. Several avenues of inquiry suggest themselves: ideas of gift exchange and commerce, histories of the role such music played in adolescent upbringing and pianism, accounts of period notions of ‘the fair sex’, and considerations of the relation between authenticity and deception in annual poetics. In the end, the author attempts to recuperate some enigma or aura for the musical score -not by appealing to some allusive or metaphysical ‘work-content’ immanent in the text, but by exploring the sense in which these volumes were and are souvenirs – perhaps remote from traditional intellectual concerns, but redolent of a bygone and elusive ‘social life’.},

  abstract  = {Our contemporary perspective of the relationship between the composer, the score and musical performance during the nineteenth century has been largely shaped by Lydia Goehr's widely accepted and equally widely contested narrative regarding the appearance of the regulative concept of the ‘musical work’ at the end of the eighteenth century. This narrative has been based on the assumption that during the nineteenth century the score was regarded as the locus of the work and the music. Goehr's account, however, is contrary to the essence of performance-oriented discourses of the nineteenth century. In this article, I present a narrative account of a neglected thread running along the music theoretical, aesthetic and pedagogical discourses of this period leading to the emergence and establishment of a profound conceptual transformation in the way the fundamentals of music making were understood and explained, and depict the rise of the concept of ‘phrasing’ as a specifically nineteenth-century phenomenon that diverges from the fundamentals of eighteenth-century performance pedagogy. I discuss the role of the new concept of phrasing in the performance theories of Mathis Lussy, Tobias Matthay and Stewart Macpherson and point out some of the widely employed metaphors and images in the teaching of phrasing during this period. The article posits that in the performance-oriented discourses of the nineteenth century, the performer's first and foremost loyalty was expected to be to ‘the music’ rather than to the score, the work or the composer.},

  abstract  = {Performance discourse in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (i.e., writing about interpretative performance in treatises, reviews, dictionaries, articles, and philosophical works) is distinct from that in both earlier and later periods. Although a full early Romantic paradigm of interpretative performance, as articulated in Hegel's Aesthetics, came about piecemeal and was instantiated in different ways in different kinds of sources, the texts examined in this essay communicate two particularly salient features. These are, first, the idea that interpretative performance involves a profound spiritual transformation on the part of the performer, requiring the merging of his own soul with that of the composer; and second, the idea that performance both establishes and collapses apparently intractable dualisms. This structural feature of performance discourse, as well as its content, links the idea of performance to contemporary discussions of consciousness in such a way that performance emerges as a simulacrum of early Romantic subjectivity. At the same time, this discursive structure also finds its way into the more mundane world of pedagogy. Performance thus emerges as more central to the intellectual milieu of Romanticism than has previously been recognized. The structures of discourse established at the turn of the nineteenth century persist in classical music culture today, but devoid of their historical underpinnings.},

  abstract  = {For the past two centuries, the culture of Western art music has consisted largely of the consumption of earlier repertories: music surviving its time, heard and reheard as a model of excellence. Already in the late 1780s, an association of Viennese noblemen headed by Gottfried van Swieten had Mozart adapt the score of Handel’s Messiah (composed half a century earlier) to meet contemporary performance needs. Around the same time, Johann Nikolaus Forkel started working on a multi-volume anthology of historically significant Denkmale der musikalischen Kunst before focusing his efforts on a stand-alone, awe-inspiring biography of J. S. Bach. Among the results of this anthologizing, Bach is still celebrated today, but few people know of Johann Kuhnau, his predecessor as Thomaskantor in Leipzig and a highly esteemed composer-scholar. Music by Bach and Beethoven was included in a 1977 LP launched by NASA into space to represent humanity to (potential) extra-terrestrial ears, whereas the 400-plus compositions of Antonio Rosetti (1750–92, a Kapellmeister with duties similar to those of Haydn) have attracted in comparison very limited interest since his death.1 No wonder that in common parlance we refer to Western art music simply as ‘classical’. It is, for better or worse, a selection of musical monuments. The idea of an artistic canon, of treating certain musicians as worthy of continued appreciation, is one of the most complex historical structures of the West. It has kept musicologists busy since the discipline’s inception in the nineteenth century, and continues to do so even as the nature of the job and its aims metamorphose through substantial disciplinary reorientations. Our tasks have gone from resembling those of diggers in or curators of an archaeological site (explaining the ingenuity, say, of the heating system underneath a Roman villa) to asking more reflexively which bits of the past are dug out with the tools we use, and which other ones, instead, remain under the dust. Rather than limiting our enquiries to who composed what and how, typical questions now include: whose story are we telling with these artefacts, and why are we telling it still? Whose values are we monumentalizing and, thus, perpetuating? Who is excluded from this picture of the past and why? In almost everything we do as scholars today—from planning research to selecting music examples for the surveys we teach— these questions loom large and have us engage with the tradition of choices made by our predecessors over about two hundred years. Curators we remain; however, the stories we tell are not just about Bach, Mozart, or Rosetti, but also, crucially, about Forkel, van Swieten, and ourselves.},

  abstract  = {Modern web publishing enables sophisticated presentation of academic arguments, deploying evidence in different formats, using multiple media types, and through interactive user experiences. However, these developments have had little significant effect on the communication of musicology, which largely continues to be published in static and linear forms, and rarely with user interfaces that connect the different forms of supporting material.Our Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework uses RDF to associate music-related materials via structures afforded by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). Here we describe the use of MELD for publishing multimedia musicology articles as web applications in which musically-meaningful relationships are mapped to the interactions a user experiences when moving between digital resources such as text, audio, video, and notation.We motivate our work with an enhanced interactive article studying the performance of works by Frederick Delius, and demonstrate our framework's suitability for this situation by implementing a MELD application integrating TEI text, IIIF-served images, MEI notation and recordings of audio and video. We describe the semantic annotations which underpin this realisation, and how they relate the user experience of moving between this content to the musicological argument being marshalled. Through this example we illustrate how connecting diverse media types using musically-meaningful semantics can support a richer form of publication, beyond the current state of the art.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a toolkit built on a reusable Linked Data framework supporting the creation of bespoke user interfaces for live events in which a scholar’s observations can be recorded. These observations are published as Linked Data annotations and, where the observations and media are accessible in a digital library, they can be subsequently played back in a synchronised, navigable interface. Since requirements for such interfaces vary widely depending on the events and the interests of the scholars involved, each interface is also likely to be different, and so we propose a toolkit rather than a single tool. Annotating scores during live events supports private analysis and the communication of musicological observations, and offers useful opportunities for indexing recorded media, so enhancing access in larger digital libraries. Although audio-visual recordings preserve high levels of detail, they can be hard to search or summarise; annotations with musical and musicological insights add structure that improves user navigation. Such annotations require carefully defined semantics and consideration of the balance between expressive sophistication and complexity of data and authoring interfaces (alongside the differing requirements of scholars). We describe our toolkit and its use in developing a tablet-based app for musicologists during a masterclass of Delius’s String Quartet. We further show adaptations made to the app to respond to its shortcomings. For scholarship in the arts and humanities, it is vital to have tools that are tailored to the specific requirements of the scholars involved and the events being annotated. We compare the highly-prescribed nature of the annotations in the Delius case with prior work involving a musicologist recording observations digitally on a score and pad during a live opera performance. This comparison leads us into a discussion of the balance between freedom and expressive power on the one hand and semantic precision on the other, finding a balance that still presents an interface that does not overly encumber a user annotating in real time is an important design consideration. We conclude that a musically-aware but generic toolkit such as ours can provide valuable support for musicological research, provided care is given to planning and design and when this balance between expression and complexity of annotations is taken into account.},

  abstract  = {The turn toward the digital has opened up previously difficult to access musical materials to wider musicological scholarship. Digital repositories provide access to publicly licensed score images, score encodings, textual resources, audiovisual recordings, and music metadata. While each repository reveals rich information for scholarly investigation, the unified exploration and analysis of separate digital collections remains a challenge. TROMPA—Towards Richer Online Music Public-domain Archives—addresses this through a knowledge graph interweaving composers, performers, and works described in established digital music libraries, facilitating discovery and combined access of complementary materials across collections. TROMPA provides for contribution of expert insights as citable, provenanced annotations, supporting analytical workflows and scholarly communication. Beyond scholars, the project targets four further user types: instrumental players; choir singers; orchestras; and music enthusiasts; with corresponding web applications providing specialised views of the same underlying knowledge graph. Thus, scholars’ annotations provide contextual information to other types of users; while performers’ rehearsal recordings and performative annotations, conductors’ marked up scores, and enthusiasts’ social discussions and listening behaviours, become available to scholarly analysis (per user consent). The knowledge graph is exposed as Linked Data, adhering to the FAIR principles of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable, and supporting further interlinking, re-interpretation and re-use beyond the immediate scope of the project.},

  abstract  = {Traditional historico-critical music editions provide scholars and musicians with an edited score based on the interpretation of various sources such as the composer's autograph(s), letters and other materials from copyists or publishers. Their digital counterparts have the potential to offer new and more expanded ways to explore the work. This is based on the possibility to provide large amounts of source materials and to annotate more extensively (since printing costs are irrelevant). Furthermore, audio and video recordings of performances can be integrated. But, similarly important, the user interface makes it much easier to navigate in the complex network of cross-references between various source materials and the editor's annotations. The XML-based Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format is the standard music representation format for digital music editions. In this article we discuss current MEI-based annotation practices and outline the current challenges for music annotations, including a discussion of anchoring options, the embedding of addressable elements in the local musical context, the annotation of audio, and the categorisation of annotations. This leads to a discussion of open questions such as the ability to secure authorship in open and reusable editions.},
